## Overview
sondera is a python package providing clients for accessing Swedish hydrology and meteorology related open data and observations.
Data sources currently include SMHI open data API and SGU groundwater API.

Development Status: Pre-Alpha.
Consider the API unstable, it may change at short or no notice.

### Data sources and licenses
It is the end users responsibility to adhere to the license of each respective
data provider. See the links to the licenses below.

## Requirements and installation

Requirements:

    numpy
	pandas
	geopandas
	requests
    tqdm

Install from pypi using pip

    pip install sondera

## General description and example usage

Observational data which is linked to a station is returned as a DataSeries object,
which contains metadata information in addition to the observed data series.

Modelling products are returned as the data series only, which is either a pandas
Series or DataFrame, or xarray for multi-dimensional data.


```python
# Example getting hourly air temperature for the latest months from
# SMHI station Stockholm-Observatoriekullen A  (number 98230)
from sondera.clients.smhi import MetObsClient, ParametersMetObs

client = MetObsClient()
# For the parameter we can pass either the ParametersMetObs enum
# or simply the SMHI integer id (which is 1 for hourly air temperature)
air_temp = client.get_observations(parameter=ParametersMetObs.TemperatureAirHour,
                         station=98230,
                         period='latest-months')

# observations are stored under "data" attribute as a pandas.Series
